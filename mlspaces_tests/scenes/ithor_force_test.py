"""iTHOR articulation force test.

For every hinge/slide joint in a scene: ramp an applied force until the joint
opens past a quarter of its range, then release and let it settle. Reports the
force each joint needed and the velocity it was left with.

Importable: `measure_scene_forces` is a pure function and nothing runs at
import. `test_articulated_joints_open` is the pytest entry point; `main()` is
the full sweep with JSON and plots, for `python ithor_force_test.py`.
